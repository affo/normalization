#Image Normalization

##Image normalization algorithm for PGM images (P2) using OpenMp and MPI

Use MPI (+OpenMP) to implement a parallel version of the image normalization algorithm. In practice, this means calculating the min and max color values of the submitted image (in parallel) and then perform the normalization (again in parallel). Use the image format you prefer (e.g., "plain ppm").
